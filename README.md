This browser extension add some features to the web Calimoto's Tour Planner:

- Links to externals map services
- One button to change routing for all waypoints
- Design changes (like bigger search bar and font size)

_This is a non-official project._

## Why this extension?

Being a passionate biker I use the Calimoto mobile app a lot for my rides. I always prepare these rides on the Calimoto web app but this one has some annoying lacks. The service is good enough that I have been subscribed to the paid offer for several years but the rare upgrades of the web platform led me to do it myself.

➡ **For the Calimoto team:** please understand it's not a "hack" of your app, only a way to enhance it.
